# Anagram Kata
This is a worked example in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) based upon the Shapes kata.

Run the tests with:

    npm test

The source of the kata is a code dojo I ran at the London Code Dojo on the Liskoff Substitution principle that you can find [here](https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox/code-dojo-11-september-2012). You can also find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
